# Cost of verify WIDTH, measured through the production path.
# At -ndt k the verify forward carries k+1 rows. If ms/forward is flat in k, extra rows are
# ~free and a TREE draft (which buys accepted-tokens-per-forward instead of relying on a
# single linear chain's acceptance) can convert width into tok/s. If ms/forward climbs
# linearly, rows cost full price and width is a dead end.
#
# ms/forward is derived: steps = tokens - accepted ; ms/fwd = wall/steps
# Log: /tmp/width_ndt.log
