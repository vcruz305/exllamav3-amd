"""Route small multi-row MoE batches through the expert-GROUPED prefill kernel.

MEASURED PROBLEM: during MTP verification the grouped-MoE DECODE kernel issues
rows * top_k independent GEMVs, one per (row, expert) pair, each re-reading that
expert's weights. Instrumenting the real selections shows 31% of those reads are
redundant -- consecutive speculative tokens pick overlapping experts (e.g. 3
rows x top-k 10 = 30 assignments covering only 16-24 unique experts).

The PREFILL path already solves this: it argsorts assignments by expert and
processes each unique expert once for up to MOE_PREFILL_ROWS_PER_CHUNK = 16
rows, so the weight read is amortized across every row that wants that expert.

But the two paths are split at a fixed row count:
    _HIP_GROUPED_MAX_ROWS   = 16      -> decode handles 1..16
    _HIP_PREFILL_MIN_ROWS   = 17      -> prefill handles 17..2048

so a 3-row verification batch NEVER reaches the deduplicating kernel, even
though it would benefit most (31% redundancy at m=3).

This makes the crossover tunable via EXL3_HIP_PREFILL_MIN_ROWS so the grouped
prefill kernel can take small batches. Default is unchanged (17).

Correctness note: the prefill kernel computes the same math (it is the same
exl3_gemv_kernel_body with MMODE 2), just with expert-major ordering and a
scatter-add at the end, so results must match -- verified with eval/ppl.py.
