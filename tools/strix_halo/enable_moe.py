"""Enable the grouped-MoE fast path on gfx11.5 (RDNA3.5 / Strix Halo).

WHY THIS IS SAFE (verified by inspection before changing anything):

exl3_moe_gfx12_k3 and exl3_moe_gfx12_k3_prefill launch only these kernels:

    moe_grouped_gemv_k3_kernel<...>          -> exl3_gemv_kernel_body<3,FP32,2,0,0,true>
    moe_prefill_grouped_gemv_k3_kernel<...>  -> exl3_gemv_kernel_body<3,FP32,2,2,CFG,true>
    moe_had_rows_kernel / moe_prefill_had_rows_kernel
    moe_silu_mul_kernel
    moe_weighted_reduce_kernel
    moe_prefill_metadata_kernel

The two grouped GEMVs are the SAME exl3_gemv_kernel_body already ported to
RDNA3.5 (WMMA family 2) -- MMODE 0 for decode, MMODE 2 for prefill, both of
which have gfx11.5 epilogues. The remaining kernels are plain elementwise /
reduction code: grep for wmma | mma_ | __builtin_amdgcn | dp4a | __shfl inside
each returns ZERO matches, so none of them carry an RDNA4 assumption.

The "gfx12" in the name is therefore historical (that was the only arch with a
WMMA GEMV when it was written), not a hardware requirement. Widen the guard to
"has a WMMA GEMV of any family" and let the shape checks do the real filtering.

Run from the repo root. Idempotent.
